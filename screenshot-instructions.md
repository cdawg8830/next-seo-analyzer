# Screenshot Instructions for Chrome Web Store Listing

You'll need to provide screenshots of your extension in action for the Chrome Web Store listing. Here are instructions for capturing effective screenshots:

## Required Screenshots

1. **Main Analysis View**
   - Visit a known Next.js website (e.g., vercel.com, nextjs.org)
   - Click on your extension icon to open the popup
   - Capture the full popup showing the completed analysis results
   - This should show the router type, metrics, and some recommendations

2. **Features Detection View**
   - Visit a Next.js site with multiple features enabled
   - Capture the popup focused on the Next.js Configuration section
   - Make sure the features badges (Image Optimization, Font Optimization, etc.) are visible

3. **Speed Score Visualization**
   - Capture a close-up of the speed score spectrum showing the gradient bar and position indicator
   - Try to find a site with a moderate score so the position indicator is visible in the middle

4. **Recommendations View**
   - Capture a screenshot focusing on the technical recommendations section
   - Choose a view that shows multiple recommendations with their impact levels

5. **Non-Next.js Site View**
   - Visit a non-Next.js website (e.g., google.com)
   - Click your extension and capture the "Not a Next.js Site" message

## Screenshot Specifications

- **Dimensions**: At least 1280x800 pixels
- **Format**: PNG or JPEG
- **Count**: Chrome Web Store requires at least 3 screenshots, but 5 is recommended
- **Borders**: Include the full extension popup with its borders in at least one screenshot

## Tips for Good Screenshots

1. **Ensure clarity**: Make sure the text is readable and not blurry
2. **Show real data**: Use real websites rather than test environments
3. **Highlight features**: Each screenshot should focus on a specific feature
4. **Be consistent**: Use the same browser theme for all screenshots
5. **Remove personal data**: Ensure no personal information is visible

Save these screenshots with descriptive names like:
- `screenshot1-analysis-view.png`
- `screenshot2-features-detection.png`
- `screenshot3-speed-score.png`
- `screenshot4-recommendations.png`
- `screenshot5-non-nextjs.png`

These screenshots will be uploaded during the Chrome Web Store submission process.
