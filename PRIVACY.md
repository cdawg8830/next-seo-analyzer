# Privacy Policy for Next.js Performance Analyzer

## Data Collection

Next.js Performance Analyzer is designed with privacy in mind. The extension:
- Only analyzes the currently active tab when explicitly activated
- Does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information
- Does not use cookies or tracking mechanisms
- Does not store any data outside of the current browser session

## Data Usage

The extension collects the following technical metrics solely for the purpose of analysis:
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Page performance metrics
- Next.js-specific implementation details

All analysis is performed locally in your browser. No data is sent to external servers.

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:
- `activeTab`: To analyze the current webpage
- `scripting`: To inject performance measurement code
- `tabs`: To handle tab-specific analysis

These permissions are used exclusively for performance analysis and providing recommendations.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not integrate with any third-party services or analytics platforms.

## Data Retention

All collected metrics are temporary and only exist during the active analysis session. Data is automatically cleared when:
- You close the extension popup
- You navigate to a different page
- You close the browser tab

## Updates

This privacy policy may be updated to reflect changes in the extension's functionality. Users will be notified of any significant changes through the Chrome Web Store update process.
